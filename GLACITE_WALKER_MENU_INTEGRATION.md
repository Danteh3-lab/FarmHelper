# Glacite Walker - Menu Integration Complete ✅

## Changes Made

The Glacite Walker combat macro has been fully integrated into the FarmHelper macro selection menu for easier access.

### Modified Files:

1. **`FarmHelperConfig.java`**
   - Added "Combat - Glacite Walker (Dwarven Mines)" to the Macro Type dropdown (option #14)
   - Added `GLACITE_WALKER_COMBAT` to the `MacroEnum`

2. **`MacroHandler.java`**
   - Added `GLACITE_WALKER_MACRO` to the `Macros` enum
   - Updated `getMacro()` to return `GlaciteWalkerMacro` when selected
   - Modified `enableMacro()` to skip garden location check for combat macros

3. **`GLACITE_WALKER_IMPLEMENTATION.md`**
   - Updated usage instructions to reflect menu integration

## How to Use

### Quick Start:
1. Open FarmHelper config: `/fh`
2. Go to **General** category
3. Select **"Combat - Glacite Walker (Dwarven Mines)"** from the **Macro Type** dropdown
4. Press your **macro toggle keybind** to start

### Alternative Methods:
- Use command: `/glacite`, `/gw`, or `/glacitewalker`
- Both methods work identically

## Benefits of Menu Integration

✅ **Easier Access** - No need to remember commands  
✅ **Consistent UX** - Works like all other macros  
✅ **Keybind Support** - Use your existing macro toggle keybind  
✅ **Visual Selection** - See it in the dropdown with other macros  
✅ **Config Integration** - All settings in one place  

## Location Requirements

**Important Difference:**
- **Farming macros**: Require you to be in the Garden
- **Glacite Walker combat**: Works in Dwarven Mines (no garden check)

The macro handler automatically detects combat macros and skips the garden location requirement.

## Configuration

All settings remain in the **"Glacite Walker Combat"** category:
- Scan Radius
- Attack Range  
- Rotation Time
- AOTV Usage
- Health Management
- Min Health Threshold

## Testing

Before using in production:
1. Select the macro from the dropdown
2. Go to Dwarven Mines
3. Press your macro toggle keybind
4. Verify it starts correctly
5. Test stopping with the keybind
6. Adjust config settings as needed

## Compatibility

✅ Works with all existing failsafes  
✅ Compatible with Discord integration  
✅ Supports webhooks and notifications  
✅ Integrates with existing keybinds  
✅ No conflicts with farming macros

**Status**: Ready to use! The combat macro is now fully integrated into the FarmHelper menu system.
